# Name: transform_sysctl.py
# Author: Larry Maloney
# Purpose: Transform logs into CSV format, and generate an R graph from the data
# Date: 03/26/2013
#  Update: 04/01/2013 added scipen option to disable scentific notation
#  Update: 04/01/2013 Rotated Y axis labels, removed Y axis title
#  Update: 04/02/2013 Yanked R string, and put in source file, gets called from system shell.
#  Update: 04/02/2013 Added cli option "--rgraph" generates R graphs, default is no graph generation.
#  Update: 04/03/2013 Added blacklist, automatically reads from blacklist.txt if file exists  
#  Update: 04/03/2013 Added logic to filter out unchanging sysctls
#  Update: 04/12/2013 Added iostat output to transform correctly
#  Update: 04/14/2013 Added function to convert human readable outputs to machine readable
#  Note: This program requires R installed.  FreeBSD 9.1 doesn't have packages for it, so you have to build from ports
#        
#  Note:  Some values from sysctls make the R graphs fai, I'v observed p1003_1b.delaytimer_max not generating a graph
#         because R complains about the ylim.  Not sure why yet, but David Wolfskill had a similar problem.  Can swing back
#         later and diagnose. 
#------------------------------
# Usage: (make sure script is made executable with chmod +x transpose_sysctl.py
# ./transpose_sysctl sysctl?????.txt 
#
# defaults with no graphing, should generate CSV file for each sysctl, with time stamp and
#                                      value like this:  Date,sysctlname
#                                                        (timestamp),1
#                                                            ...
#
# Option: --rgraph (Generates a Graph using R)
# example: ./transpose_sysctl sysctl??.txt --rgraph
# 
# Creates a .PNG file of the sysctl value over time.
# --------------------------------------------------
# Dependencies:
#
#   FreeBSD 9 or up: Should work on prior versions, but developed on 9 and tested
#
#   capture_config.sh: Script file should be included with this, does the actual capture of data.
#
#   R:   R port or package, available in ports in: /usr/ports/math/R .   R has a bunch of dependencies, 
#        if you can use the package go for it)
#
#   data: You should have some pre-made data files created with the "capture_config.sh" script. 
#         You should see files created like sysclt_vm_1_sec.txt, or sysctl_all_1_sec.txt
#
#  Full stack usage:
#  ------------------
#  1.) Edit the capture_config.sh file with the appropriate NFS mount point and directory you want the data stored.
#  2.) run: % ./capture_config.sh
#  3.) Let it run over the time you want to capture data. (run in screens, tmux or background to make sure you don't lose your session)
#  4.) ctlr-C the program when your done.  Note: double check that all the netstat, and iostat programs are killed off just incase)
#  5.) run transpose_sysctl.py
#
#  Example run: % ./transpose_sysctl.py sysctl_all_1_sec.txt --rgraph
#  
#  If all goes right, this will post process your data, in to .PNG graphs.
